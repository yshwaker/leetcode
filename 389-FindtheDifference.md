# Code

## Description
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

## Python Solution
```
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        lowerLetters = [0] * 26;
        for i in range(len(s)):
            index = ord(s[i]) - ord('a')
            lowerLetters[index] += 1
        for i in range(len(t)):
            index = ord(t[i]) - ord('a')
            lowerLetters[index] -= 1
        for i in range(len(lowerLetters)):
            if lowerLetters[i] != 0:
                return chr(ord('a') + i)

```

```
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        str = s + t
        xor = 0
        for ch in str:
            xor ^= ord(ch)
        return chr(xor)

```

## Some thinking

1. store an hash table
2. concatenate two string, xor each character, the left one is the character only appeared once. Refer to 136. Single Number

ord(c) return an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character
chr(i) Return a string of one character whose ASCII code is the integer i.
